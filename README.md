This repo may be later changed to CHE412 overall, 

## Useful Reaction Information

| Flow Regime | Residence Time (s) |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| Laminar | 194.2 |
| Transition | 107.9 |
| Turbulent | 48.6 |

## Arrhenius Equation

k_o = 1.05\*10^3 m^3/(mol\*s)
E_A = 39.9 kJ/mol
T = 295.49 K

## Initial Concentration

Use initial concentration of NaOH and NaOH at some point in the reaction
Using

$$\frac{C_{A,0} - C_{A}}{\nu_{A}} = \frac{C_{B,0} - C_{B}}{\nu_{B}}$$

and

$$ C_{X} = \frac{K - K_\infty }{K_{0} - K_{\infty}} * C_{X,0}$$

where $C_{X}$ and $C_{X,0}$ are concentration of species in question

set up system of equations to solve for initial Concentration of Ethyl Acetate.
