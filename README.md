This repo may be later changed to CHE412 overall, 

## Useful Reaction Information

| Flow Regime | Residence Time (s) |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| Laminar | 194.2 |
| Transition | 107.9 |
| Turbulent | 48.6 |

## Arrhenius Equation

$k_{0}$ = 1.05\*10^3 m^3/(mol\*s)

$E_{A}$ = 39.9 kJ/mol

$T$ = 295.49 K

## Initial Concentration

Assume $C_{EtAct,0}$ to be 0.1M for the time being.
